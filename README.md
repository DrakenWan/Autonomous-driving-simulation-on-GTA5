# Autonomous-driving-simulation-on-GTA5

This is a implementation of [Sentdex GTA 5 series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks4MPfMq8aQ&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeETZEOy4VdocT7TOjfSA8a)

The changes made are: -
1. Key combination used are [W,WA,WD,S].
2. The model is trained on 160x90 size of input images.
3. The model used is inception_v3 with residual block.

The model is trained on total of 100k images on 2.6GHz Intel Core i7-6700HQ 4 cores, 8 threads, Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M with 4GB GDDR5.
If you want the pretrained model you can find model in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OsrTovUDXBRdQ5O_bpJ0z-1UhKa2mvAB?usp=sharing).

The data is collected on location shown and vehicle used is scooter.
